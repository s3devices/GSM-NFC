# GSM-NFC

It is GSM/GPRS and NFC Shield. You can use your UDOO, Arduino and Raspberry pi boards. GSM/GPRS is a cell phone network with GPRS shield to dial a phone number or send a text to your friend via easy to use AT commands now. This is quad band low power consumption GSM/GPRS and GPS module SIM928A as well as a compact PCB antenna. You can directly interface with your main board to communicate. It is more concise and reliable. We ported together in this module as Near Field Communication (NFC) is a set of short-range wireless technologies.It’s behind daily application such as access the control system and mobile payment system. It’s a highly integrated transceiver module PN532 which handles contactless communication at 13.56MHz. You can read and write a 13.56MHz tag with this module. To implement point to point data exchange with two NFCs.
